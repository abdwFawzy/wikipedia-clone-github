	https://github.com/mariajmr1202/wikipedia-clone
### live preview
    https://mariajmr1202.github.io/wikipedia-clone/

## how to run it
	git clone  
	python3 manage.py runserver

## issues i see in the project 
	the algorithm for searching the entries is liner search which mean O(n)	which is pretty bad design decision projects like 		wiki have millions of entriesï¿½
